### Andrew - My path to working in digital marketing and e-commerce

I needed to do a better job of telling companies why they should hire me and why I would be a good fit at their company.

Once I started making a better effort to tell my own story and own my experiences, I started to see more success when I was actually inteviewing.

For anybody who's transitioning out of military service, my number one recommendation would be to talk with people who are in the civilian world already.
