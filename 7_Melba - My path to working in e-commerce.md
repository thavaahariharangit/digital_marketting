### Melba - My path to working in e-commerce

I realized, If she can do it, so can I. I went home that exact same day, and I started researching a career in marketing.

I found that, often times, I needed to sit with the materials and be able to do it at my own pace.

As a latina, it's really important that in the work that I do, I am able to give back to my community and really make sure that their voice is being recognized.
