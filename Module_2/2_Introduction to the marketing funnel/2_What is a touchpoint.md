## What is a touch point

Before a purchase happens, each interaction with a brand during a customer journey is called a **touchpoint**

Touchpoints occurs when a customer engages with your website or mobile app.
And it also includes all media channels before a customer discovers your website.


### Touchpoints relate to specific context or need

For example, instead of classifying `social media` as a touch point, classify customer's response to a flash sale announcement on Twitter as a touch point. When they `click the link`, they are interested in knowing what they can purchase at a discounted price.

Touch points have context and reflect customer needs. In the example, the context was curiosity, and the need was saving money.


### Touchpoints are customer-centric

Touchpoints should also be customer-centric.

Going back to the previous example, imagine if you viewed touchpoints from the perspective of the business instead of for the customer experience.

If incresing sales is a business goal, touchpoints can easily become part of a rolling calculation, like a ratio of touchpoints to purchases.

### Key takeaways

- Use touchpoints to your advantage.
- To get the most from touchpoints, carefully define them for all media channels.
- Touchpoints that are customer-centric and relate back to their needs will yield the most useful data about customer motivations, preferences and behaviors.
