## Janice - Inclusive marketing

"Representation is really important, not just because it is the right thing to do. It's important that people can see themselves in your work, so that they feel like they matter, so that they feel visible."

"Am I representing a group in a way that can be harmful to them?"

"Who am I trying to reach, and are they represented in this piece of work?"

"Who's missing? who is not in the room?"
