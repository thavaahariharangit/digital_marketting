## Inclusive marketing

***Inclusive marketing** is the practice of improving representation and belonging within the marketing and advertising materials that an organization creates.

### Why inclusive marketing matters?

If a company focuses its marketing exclusively on a specific age group, gender, ethnicity or other identity traits, they're likely missing out on reaching potential customers.

By approaching marketing decisions with a focus on inclusion, a company can positively and authentically market to the diversity that exists in their audience, and the world.


### Making inclusive choices and avoiding stereotypes

Here is a list of some identity traits that are helpful to keep in mind when you're creating marketing or advertising materials for the people you're trying to reach:
1. Race
2. Socioeconomic status
3. Age
4. Ability
5. Gender
6. Sexual orientation
7. Religion
8. Geographic location
9. Culture
10. Political perspective
11. Military status
12. Languages spoken


Gathering information about your audience's demographics can help you broaden your perspective. By understanding their needs and desires, you can find a way to reach this group of people in a manner that matters to them.

If your company's marketing efforts don't feature people with disablities or address their needs, they may not view your company's products or services as relevant to them.

That's why it's important to think deeply about your audience and their needs to make sure their perspectives and stories are brought to life through the company's marketing and advertising material.


### Key takeaways
- Whether you're developing marketing goals, researching your target audience, planning a marketing campaign, or analysing data, keep in mind the principles of inclusive marketing.
- Maintaining a broader perspective of your audience will help you establish a deeper connection with your customers.
