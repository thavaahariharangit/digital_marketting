## Test your knowledge: Engage customers with social media and email marketing

1. Tracking and analyzing social media conversations and mentions related to a brand is an example of social listening and engagement. This is one of the five pillars of social media marketing.

2. The advantages of using paid social media ads include: expanding a brand's reach, remarketing products, and serving ads to highly specific customer groups.

3. Email marketing is when a brand sends messages to a list of existing subscribers to share information, drive sales, or create community. When it is done well, email marketing helps brands build and maintain relationships with potential and existing customers.

4. Dividing an email subscriber list into smaller groups based on criteria like interests, location or purchase history is called email segmentation.

5. Email personalization includes: addressing each recipient directly, sending messages that match where customers are in the marketing funnel, and following up on previous interactions.
