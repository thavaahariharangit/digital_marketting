## Display advertising

### What is display advertising?

**Display ads** are visual ad formats placed on webpages or apps. Display ads are images, text, videos or GIFs that are submitted to display networks and then placed in front of your ideal audience to promote your brand, service or product.

**Display network** is a group of websites, videos, and apps where your ads can appear.
Display networks allow marketers to target ads to particular audiences, contexts, locations and more.

Google Display Network
Taboola

**Ad exchanges**, digital marketplaces where buyers and sellers come together and enter into real-time bidding process to buy and sell ad space.

Agencies and advertisers typically bid on impressions from ad exchanges via a tool called a demand-side platform.
