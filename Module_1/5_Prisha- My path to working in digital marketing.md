### Prisha - My path to working in digital marketing

I love being able to make a difference and really putting out the best possible content there is for my clients, users, or for anyone out there.

If you are passionate about something, that will carry you forward through any role or through any interview.

Finding a mentor can be really helpful. with your mentor, you can actually work on short-term goals, long-term goals, and they can help you with the different fears you may have.
