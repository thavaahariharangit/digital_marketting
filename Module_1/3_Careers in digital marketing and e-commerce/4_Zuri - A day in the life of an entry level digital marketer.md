### Zuri - A day in the life of an entry level digital marketer

I am confident that if you look hard enough, you can find transferable skills and key charateristics that are transferable to an entry-level digital marketing role.

As an entry-level marketer, I work with a lot of teams to make sure the customer voice is heard.

What I like most about working in digital marketing has to be creativity. I am able to operate as a creative, as a strategic thinker, and also as a problem solver.
