## Case study: How MERSEA structures its marketing funnel

In 2013, Lina Dickinson and Melanie Bolin founded MERSEA, a lifestyle brand located in Lenexa, Kansas, offering clothing, accessories, and home fragrances.

### The challenge

Imagine the perspective of a business owner.

You have a functional business store.

But, how can you get potential customers to visit the online store?
And, after attracting customers, how can you encourage those customers to revisit
the store and become repeat customers?


### The approach

They hired an outside marketing company to assist with Google Ads. Working with a marketing company outside of the business allows the founders and its employees to focus on what they're best at, creating outsatanding products.

MERSEA's marketing strategies

#### Awareness
For the awareness stage, MERSEA uses online ads including Google Ads and Facebook Ads.

Google Ads,
- Search ads for brandname and product searches.
- Shopping ads for specific types of products.
For the Facebook Ads, MERSEA advertises to potential customers for lifestyle-based targeting.

### Consideration
During the consideration marketing funnel stage, MERSEA continues to apply online advertising, and also uses social media marketing and email marketing.

Online advertising - Delivering ads to the people who previously visits the website
they then receives the ad to products that they viewed

Remarketing ads build interest in the potential customer.

### Conversion

Sending follow up mail if the customer provided their email while checkout.
The follow-up leads to an increase in the conversion rate.

During the loyalty stage, MERSEA turns its paying customers into repeat customers.

Sending regular email and text messages afte the purchase of the product.
