## Data ethics

Knowing how to work with user data responsibly and legally is critical to the integrity of your organization, role, and projects.

### Data ethics

**Data ethics** is the study and evaluation of moral challenges related to data collection and analysis.
- Follow regulations
- Demonstrate trustworthiness in protecting customer data
- Ensure the use of customer data is fair and without bias

#### Follow regulation:

**Personally identifiable data (PID):** is information that can be used to directly identify, contact or locate an individual.

**Data privacy:** refers to the proper handling of data. How you collect, process, anaylze, share, archive, and delete data should be in accordance with the data privacy laws of the countries where your customers reside.

#### Protect customer data

**Data anonymization:** refers to one or more techniques to mask or remove personal information from data to protect the identities of people.

Types of data often anonymized are names, telephone numbers, email addresses, photographs, account numbers, and purchase transactions.

#### Use data fairly and without bias

**Data bias:** is a type of human error that skews results in a certain direction.

Note that data bias isn't the same as selecting data from a target audience.

What would be considered data bias is if you exclude the data from customers who returned products because you don't consider them loyal to your brand.

**Pro tip:** To minimize the risk of data bias, ask for peer review of critical data that you intend to use so you can incorporate different perspectives right away.


### Key takeaways
- Data ethics is important because it promotes the responsible use of customer data.
- Always be careful to follow the data privacy laws in your country and the countries where your customers live, protect customer data, and avoid data bias.
