## Story structure

Data storytelling is the practice of explaining data insights to a specific audience using a clear and compelling narrative.

### The three-part data story structure

**Context:**
Think of your context as the framing of the situation.
For example, imagine your company had a decrease in both sales and their customer base last year. The company's goals are to maximize profits and grow their customer base this year. Those goals may be the context of your story.

**Complication:**
This is typically the reason the situation requires action.
For example, If your company's goals are to maximise profit and grow their customer base, and the data shows you are on track to meet the first goal but not the second one, that is a complication.

**Resolution:**
The resolution of your data story is the necessary action taken to solve a problem or leverage an opportunity.
How did the story end?
What were the results of the complication?
What do your results tell you about the campaign?

For instance, if the results show that you are maximizing your profits but are not driving new customers, explain the data-driven action you will be taking to change that.


**Context:** 
You didn't reach that goal during your last campaign, and you want to review the data of your current campaign to see if it is performing better.

**Complication:**
You notice an increase in both ROAS and conversion rates.
That increase is the complication of your campaign.

**Resolution:**
Did the ROAS and conversion rates increase because you changed the copy, switched out the images, ran a promotion in your ads, or something else? your findings are your resolution.

### Key takeaways
- Data isn't just numbers and figures.
- Data tells a storty that can be integral to your company's future success.
- To create effective campaigns, you have to find the stories in the data.
- Identifying your context, complication, and resolution will help you get there.
