## Plan and publish content

1. For platforms with chronological feeds, posting multiple times a day gives a digital marketer the opportunity to reach their target audience in different time zones and at various points throughout their day.

2. For algorithm-based platforms, it is better to publish quality content less frequently. Too many posts can result in a drop in engagement.

3. Using social media calendar enables a digital marketer to schedule their posts in advance. This saves them time and enables them to maintain a consistent posting schedule. It allows a digital marketer to organize all of the content for their posts in one centralized location and makes it easier to share their social media calendar with stakeholders for review.

4. Each entry in a social media calendar usually includes these elements: The data and time of the post will go live, the topic of the post and the links to any assets.

5. To develop a social media calendar, digital marketer needs to first identify the social media platforms the want to post on. Then, they need to review their current content. They should assess things like what types of posts get the most engagement. Next, they need to decide what data they want their social media content calendar to track.
