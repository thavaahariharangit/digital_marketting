## Determine the frequency and timing of posts

**Chronological feed:**
A stream that displays the latest published content first.

**Social media algorithm:**
A wat of sorting posts in a users feed based on relevancy rather than the order in which they are published.

For **algorithm-based platforms**, it's better to publish quality content less frequently, as too many posts can result in a drop in engagement.

**Note:**
Social media algorithms sort posts in a user's feed based on relevancy rather than the order in which they are published.

**Consider:**
- When your target audience is active online
- Your best-performing posts
- Seasons and holidays
- Current events
