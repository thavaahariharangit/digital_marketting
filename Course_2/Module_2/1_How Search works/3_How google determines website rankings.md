## How Google determines website rankings

### Key factors
- Meaning of the query
- Relevance of webpages
- Quality of the content
- Usablity of webpages
- Context and settings

### Query:
The words typed into a Google search bar

The search algorithm needs to establish what the user is searching for. In other words, the intent behind the query.

### Keyword
A word, or multiple words, that people use to find information, products, or services online. 

**Note:** The Google search algorithms review keywords for relevance of webpages. In addition to keywords, the algorithm also matches phrases and topics the searcher may be interested in. 

The webpage that has a better user experience may perform better.

Information such as their location, past search history, and search settings help the search algorithm deliver relevant and useful results.
