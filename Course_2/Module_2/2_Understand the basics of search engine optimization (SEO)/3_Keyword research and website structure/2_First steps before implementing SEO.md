## First steps before implementing SEO

- You need to make sure the work you're doing helps the organization achieve its goals.

- As a marketing professional, you may have influence over these goals.

- Great SEO-based content marketers don't create content for Google search results first. They create content for people first, Google second.

- To create better content than the competition, you must first study what they have created. Study what they have done, and then do it better.


### Pre-SEO work
