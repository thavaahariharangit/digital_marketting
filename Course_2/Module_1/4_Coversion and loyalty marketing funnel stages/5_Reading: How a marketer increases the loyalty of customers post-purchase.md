## How a marketer increases the loyalty of customers post-purchase

In th loyalty stage of the marketing funnel, businesses encourage paying customers to become repeat customers and brand advocates.

Strategies to build loyalty

### Social shares
Social shares are when a person shares a brand's content with their social media followers.

Giveaways to customers who share their recent purchase on social media.

### Encourage reviews
Reviews indicate how satisfied a customer is with a purchase.

When someone takes the time to write about why they are satisfied with a product, the reviewer develops positive feelings about the product and builds brand loyalty.

To receive more product reviews, they decide to send a followup email to the customer encouraging them to write a review one week after the leather phone case gets delivered.

### Send freebies
Along with their products, they send a branded stcker, small magnet, and instructional card that tells the customer how to care for the leather product.

Some customers will place the magnet on the refrigerator and the sticket on their laptop or water bottle.
This public display of a brand turns them into brand advocates.

### Remarket customers with other products
They also sell items such as leather watch bands, wallet and tablet cases.
They would like to advertise these products to previous customers and turn them into repeat customers.

Remarketing ads are advertisments deliverred to previous purchasers, subscribers, or visitors to a website.

For example, if a customer purchased a brown leather phone case, they may receive ads with a brown leather wallet to complement the case.

### Key takeaways
By providing social share opportunities, encouraging reviews, sending freebies, and remarketing customers with other products
can build brand loyalty.

Turning previous customers into loyal promoters of the brand is a low-cost or no-cost way to get even more sales.
