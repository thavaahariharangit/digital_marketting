## Explore: Data storytelling

**Context:**
Juan knows the importance of giving relevant context. 
He explains the question he posed:
Why aren't rain jackets meeting their ROAS goal? 
The he gives some metrics he examined to answer it:
CPC, conversion rate, and average order value.

**Complication:**
Juan compares rain jacket metrics to winter coats.
The conversion rate and CPC are similar,
so he thought the ROAS should be similar, too.

Using a bar graph, he explains the complication:
rain jackets have a lower average order value.

**Resolution:**
Juan explains that they were tracking the wrong metric.
Low average order value for rain jackets means they can't reach their ROAS target.
He advises shifting some budget to coats to raise the overall ROAS.
Then he takes audience questions.

**Review:**
Using data storytelling elements and a three-part story structure,
Juan created a compelling presentation that was clear.
relevant to his audience, and action-oriented.
